## ðŸš€ Objective
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of MongoDB including:
- Setting up a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Creating a database and collection
- Performing CRUD operations
- Running advanced queries with filtering, projection, sorting, and pagination
- Building aggregation pipelines
- Implementing indexing for performance optimization

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Using MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a free account.
2. Create a new project and build a free-tier cluster.
3. Add a database user and allow access from your IP address.
4. Connect to your cluster using MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`).
5. Use the connection string provided by Atlas to connect.

### Option 2: Using MongoDB Locally
1. Download and install MongoDB Community Edition from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Start the MongoDB server and connect using `mongosh` or MongoDB Compass.
